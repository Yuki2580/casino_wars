# Casino Wars Project

Our project is a city-based and personal-based leaderboard point earning SocialFi game framework. To play these games, you must own a city NFT, which can be minted through the city NFT frame. Once you have a city NFT, you are eligible to play three games: Roulette, Rock Paper Scissors (RPS), and Coin Flip, each once per day.

This project consists of several applications below

1. NFT contract
2. IPFS image and metadata files for NFT
3. City NFT mint frame
4. Casino Wars main game frame
5. Leaderboard frame
